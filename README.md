## 👋 Hi, I'm Sekou Traore

🎓 Computer Scientist (M.S. in Computer Science)  
🔐 Interests: Cybersecurity, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Software Development  

This repository serves as my personal portfolio, where I showcase projects and experiments that reflect my technical interests and continuous learning. I enjoy understanding systems deeply, improving existing solutions, and building new ones with clarity and purpose.

## 🧠 About Me

Inspired by Kerckhoffs’s principle, I believe strong systems — and strong engineers — rely on sound design rather than obscurity. I’m motivated by the idea that the human brain is the most powerful computer we have, and that thoughtful problem-solving can meaningfully improve the world around us.

I’m particularly interested in how algorithmic design, cybersecurity, machine learning, and software development intersect to solve complex, real-world problems. I actively seek opportunities to grow my skills and apply them in practical, hands-on ways.
